    <p>These shrimp burritos are inspired by ones served at a Mexican restaurant where I worked. I moved away, so I had to create my own. The chipotle sauce makes these burritos so yummy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Rice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>¾ cup long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>½ cup canned diced tomatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chipotle Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pureed chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Refried Beans</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Shrimp</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>12 ounces frozen cooked shrimp without tails, thawed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Burritos</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste</li>
        <li>6 (10 inch) flour tortillas, warmed</li>
        <li>⅓ cup salsa, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook rice: Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until tender. Add rice, garlic salt, and cumin. Cook and stir until rice is lightly toasted, about 5 minutes. Pour in broth and tomatoes; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>While rice is cooking, make chipotle sauce: Stir together yogurt, mayonnaise, and chipotle peppers in a small bowl until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Make refried beans: Stir together refried beans, garlic salt, and black pepper in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through.</li>
        <li>Cook shrimp: Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; coat with cooking spray. Stir together shrimp and garlic in a large bowl until combined. Sauté shrimp mixture in the hot skillet until heated through and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Assemble burritos: Place 1/4 cup cheese onto each warm tortilla. Lay shrimp evenly over cheese. Top each with about 1/4 cup beans and 1/4 cup rice. Drizzle with desired amount of chipotle sauce and salsa. Roll up burrito-style to serve.</li>
    </ol>
